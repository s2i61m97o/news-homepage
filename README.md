## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to create a hamburger menu
- Practise with using Grid for layouts - I tend to favour Flexbox.
- I also used the [Responsively App](https://responsively.app/) for the first time, which makes it a lot easier to view your project across multiple screen sizes at once and the effects changes make to those different screen sizes.

### Continued development

- Practise using Grid and Flexbox in layout
- Continue to use Responsively in development

### Useful resources

- [This article on dev.to](https://dev.to/ljcdev/easy-hamburger-menu-with-js-2do0) helped with understanding how to create a simple hamburger menu
